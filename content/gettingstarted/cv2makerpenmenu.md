## CV2 Menu

To get to the CV2 menu, you first need to open the Maker Pen Palette, this can be achieved by going to:

```
Watch > Backback > Maker Pen > Use
```
![On PC Screen](https://github.com/Alexa-RR/RecRoomCV2-Docs/blob/master/content/Images/MakerPen/PcScreenMakerpen.gif?raw=true)

<Info> You need Maker Pen Permissions (see Watch > This Room > Settings > Permissions) to use CV2 in Custom Rooms. </Info>


<Info> You can also favorite it by clicking the Favorite button right next to the Use button in the Backpack menu such that it is easier to pull out the Maker Pen later. </Info>

After that, go to the Palette:

For VR players:
```
Look at the screen of the Maker Pen > Press "Open Palette"
```
For PC Players on screen:
```
Prees F > Open Palette
```
