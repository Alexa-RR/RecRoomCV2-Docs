## CV2 Menu

To get to the CV2 menu you first need to open the Makerpen Palette, this can be done by going to:

```
Watch > Backback > Maker Pen > Use
```
![On PC Screen](https://github.com/Alexa-RR/RecRoomCV2-Docs/blob/master/content/Images/MakerPen/PcScreenMakerpen.gif?raw=true)

<Info> You need Maker pen Permissions to use CV2 in Custom Rooms </Info>


<Info> You can also favorite it by clicking the Favorite button right next to use in the Backpack menu so it would be easier to pull out the Maker pen later </Info>

After That go to the Palette:

For VR players:
```
Look at the screen of the Maker Pen > Press "Open Palette"
```
For PC Players on screen:
```
Prees F > Open Palette
```

<Tip> I recommend using the search tab as its more conferrable to search chips </Tip>
