In cv2 we have 2 execution types:

## Local execution
in local execution the circuity runs locally, for example if there are 2 players in a room and one player presses a button that turns on a local light, Only that player will see the light on.

<Tip>As of today CV2 doesn't have local lights yet so in practice this is not possible yet but may come in the future!</Tip>

## Synced execution
in synced execution the circuity runs globally, for example if there are 2 players in a room and one player presses a button that turns on a synced light, all of the players will see the light turn on.

<Tip> Fun Fact: Synced execution is also called Global execution in the programing world </Tip>
