## In CV2 we have 20 value types!
![](https://github.com/Alexa-RR/RecRoomCV2-Docs/blob/master/content/gettingstarted/Images/ValueTypes.jpg?raw=true)

If you hover over value types ``` Bool ```, ``` Float ```, ``` int ``` and ``` String ``` ports using the wire tool you are able to view their current value

<Info> the value that you are getting when hovering over the port might not be the same for other players </Info>



Let's go over each one!
